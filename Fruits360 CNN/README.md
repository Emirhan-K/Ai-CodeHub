# Fruit Recognition Model with CNN

This repository contains a deep learning model trained for fruit recognition using the Fruit360 dataset. The model utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to classify various fruits into different categories.

## Dataset

The Fruit360 dataset is a comprehensive collection of fruit images, comprising 81 different fruit classes with a total of over 50,000 images. Each class in the dataset represents a specific type of fruit, making it a suitable choice for training models aimed at fruit recognition tasks.

For more information about the Fruit360 dataset, please refer to [Fruit360 GitHub repository](https://github.com/Horea94/Fruit-Images-Dataset).

## Model Architecture

The model architecture used for training is based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). CNNs are powerful for image classification tasks, as they can automatically learn hierarchical features from the input images.
