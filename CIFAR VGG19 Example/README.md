# CIFAR-10 Image Classification with VGG-19 Example

This repository contains a deep learning model trained for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset and the VGG-19 architecture. The model is designed to classify images into 10 different classes, each representing a specific object or animal.

## Dataset

The CIFAR-10 dataset is a well-known benchmark for image classification tasks. It consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is split into 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

For more information about the CIFAR-10 dataset, please refer to the [CIFAR-10 website](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).

## Model Architecture

The model architecture used for training is VGG-19 (Visual Geometry Group - 19 layers). VGG-19 is a deep convolutional neural network with 19 layers, known for its strong performance in image classification tasks. It consists of 16 convolutional layers and 3 fully connected layers.
