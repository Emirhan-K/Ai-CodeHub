# Fruit360 Dataset and VGG-16 Example

This repository contains a deep learning model trained for fruit recognition using the Fruit360 dataset and the VGG-16 architecture. The model is designed to classify various fruits into different categories.

## Dataset

The Fruit360 dataset is a comprehensive collection of fruit images, comprising 81 different fruit classes with a total of over 50,000 images. Each class in the dataset represents a specific type of fruit, making it a suitable choice for training models aimed at fruit recognition tasks.

For more information about the Fruit360 dataset, please refer to [Fruit360 GitHub repository](https://github.com/Horea94/Fruit-Images-Dataset).

## Model Architecture

The model architecture used for training is VGG-16 (Visual Geometry Group - 16 layers). VGG-16 is a deep convolutional neural network known for its simplicity and effectiveness in image classification tasks. The architecture consists of 16 layers, including 13 convolutional layers and 3 fully connected layers.
