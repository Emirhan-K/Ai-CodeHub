# MNIST Digit Recognition with CNN

This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained for digit recognition using the MNIST dataset. The model is designed to classify hand-written digits from 0 to 9.

## Dataset

The MNIST dataset is a collection of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits, labeled from 0 to 9. It is a widely used benchmark dataset for image classification tasks.

For more information about the MNIST dataset, please refer to [MNIST Dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/mnist).

## Usage

When using repostory, extract the `data.rar`file and edit the file path in the code.
