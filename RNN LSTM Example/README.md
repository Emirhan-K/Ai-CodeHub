# Stock Price Prediction Example with RNN

This repository contains two deep learning models for time series prediction: one using RNN for Google Stock Price prediction and the other using LSTM for the International Airline Passengers dataset.

## Google Stock Price Prediction with RNN

### Dataset

The Google Stock Price dataset consists of historical stock prices for Google. The dataset includes features such as Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume for each trading day.

### Model Architecture

The model architecture for Google Stock Price prediction is based on a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). RNNs are well-suited for sequence data, making them suitable for time series prediction tasks.



## International Airline Passengers Prediction Example with LSTM

### Dataset

The International Airline Passengers dataset consists of the monthly total number of international airline passengers from 1949 to 1960.

### Model Architecture

The model architecture for International Airline Passengers prediction is based on a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. LSTMs are well-suited for capturing long-term dependencies in time series data.
